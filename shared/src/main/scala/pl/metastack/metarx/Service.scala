/**
  * A Service is an abstraction for a small processing unit that takes a request
  * and responds asynchronously. The communication is therefore entirely
  * message-driven. The messages are epxected to be immutable. A service can
  * have an internal state that will not be exposed. Services can be composed
  * and requests may be forwarded to other services. The concept is inspired by
  * Akka's actors.
